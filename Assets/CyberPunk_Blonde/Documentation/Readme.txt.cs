     * The animations and animator are located in the "Animations" folder. The Sprites are located in the "Sprites" folder, under "CyberPunk_Blonde".
     * Copy both of these folders into your own project if you only care about the sprites and animations. 
     * 
     * Load the "Demo" scene from the "Prefabs" folder in order to test out the sprites and character in a scene. This will also load a script onto the player that'll allow movement using the "A" and "D" keys and "Spacebar".
